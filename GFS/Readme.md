# Global Forecast System (GFS)

## Data Overview:
The NOAA Global Forecast System (GFS) is a global numerical weather prediction system containing a global computer model and variational analysis run by the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS). The model is divided into 127 vertical layers extending from the surface to the mesopause (~80km). The entire globe is covered by the GFS at a base horizontal resolution of 13 kilometers between grid points. The GFS is run operationally four times a day and produces forecasts for up to 16 days in advance. Hundreds Of atmospheric and land-soil variables are available through this dataset, from temperatures, winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and atmospheric ozone concentration.
