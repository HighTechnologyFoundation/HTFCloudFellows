    "# Climate-Informed Cybersecurity Preparedness in North Carolina\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use NOAA Climate Data Products to identify areas of high risk for cybersecurity threats related to natural disasters like Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, focusing on Asheville and Greenville.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "- **Identify Critical Infrastructure**: Locate data centers throughout North Carolina with the aid of publicly-available websites and web scraping tools.\n",
    "- **Determine High Risk Zones**: Assess flood-prone areas and identify data centers most vulnerable to flooding and damage.\n",

    "> ### Disclaimer: Understanding the Complexity of Hydrologic Physics\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Hydrology, the branch of science dedicated to understanding water movement and distribution, involves a range of factors that influence flood risk and water resource management. Additional factors may include soil saturation, watershed characteristics, river flow dynamics, evaporation rates, and topography. While this example uses precipitation totals as an indicator, it is important to note that **precipitation totals alone are not sufficient for a comprehensive climate-adjacent risk assessment**.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> \n",
    "> This example represents a simplified approach to climate-related risk assessment. Students are encouraged to build on this foundation by adding more complex variables from various datasets.

    "\n",
    "In the face of increasing flooding volatility due to climate change, you are apart of a technology firm that is proactively assessing potential risks to data centers across its North Carolina footprint, especially in light of unprecedented damage brought by Hurricane Helene. The firm needs to conduct a preliminary analysis to evaluate the need for redundant data centers in safer locations. As part of this assessment, we need to identifying potential weaknesses in our Asheville data center's network infrastructure, which might be at greater risk for cyber attacks if physical damage from flooding were to occur again. Our goal is to develop a robust strategy to strengthen our resilience against climate-related cyber threats and ensure the continuity of our operations."

This notebook serves as a quick and easily executable tool, allowing for rapid assessment of forecasted precipitation alongside critical infrastructure locations when locally volatile weather is anticipated.\n"
