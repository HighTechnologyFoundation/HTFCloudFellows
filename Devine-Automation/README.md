README

Prerequisite Requirements
AWS CLI
Hashicorp Terraform
Docker Engine

Linux Setup
AWS CLI
Following the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html, use the Linux tab and follow the Command line installer guide for the current system
In order to setup the AWS CLI, the AWS account needs to have an access key created. Follow https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey to create a key. Do not click out of the "Retrieve acceess key" page without downloading the csv file or copying and storing the "Secret access key".
In a terminal, run ```aws configure``` and input the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key created in the previous step. Set the default region to us-east-1 and default output format to json.

Hashicorp Terraform
Following the guide at https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install#linux, install the terraform package.

Docker Engine
Following the guide at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository, install docker.
After the installation is complete, a group named "docker" should be created. If the docker group is missing, run the following ```sudo addgroup docker```.
Add your user account to the docker group by using the following: ```sudo adduser USERNAME docker``` replacing USERNAME with your username. This step will require you to log out of your account and log in again for changes to take place.

Windows Setup
TBD

Running the Terraform Builder
Copy main.tf into the same directory as the Dockerfile and all required dependencies.
Run the following commands in the same directory as main.tf:
```terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply```

The command ```terraform plan``` should provide an output describing the resources to be created as follows:
