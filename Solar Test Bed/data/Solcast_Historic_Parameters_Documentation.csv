Name,Units,Full Name,Description
air_temp,°C,Air Temperature,The air temperature at 2 meters above surface level.
albedo,0 - 1,Albedo Daily,"The average daytime surface reflectivity of visible light, expressed as a fractional value between 0 and 1. 0 represents complete absorption. 1 represents complete reflection. This is an interpolated daily average value, therefore does not capture any diurnal angular dependence of reflectivity."
azimuth,°,Solar Azimuth Angle,"The angle between the horizontal direction of the sun, and due north, with negative angles eastwards and positive values westward . Varies from -180 to 180. A value of -90 means the sun is in the east, 0 means north, and 90 means west."
cape,J/kg,Thunderstorm potential (CAPE),"Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is the energy available for a thunderstorm. CAPE provides an estimate of the energy that a thunderstorm updraught will release as it rises and the water vapour it contains condenses to liquid water, releasing latent heat. It is a measure of deep atmospheric instability which is one of the necessary conditions for a thunderstorm. While large values of CAPE (many 100s to 1000s of J/kg) indicate a favourable environment for a thunderstorm to occur, to get a thunderstorm it is also necessary to have a triggering mechanism to initiate it, and other suitable environmental wind and moisture conditions to support its growth. Large values of CAPE, when combined with precipitation_rate output being > 0 can be used as a simple proxy for a thunderstorm event."
clearsky_dhi,W/m2,Clearsky Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI),"The diffuse irradiance received on a horizontal surface (if there are no clouds). Also referred to as Diffuse Sky Radiation. The diffuse component is irradiance that is scattered by the atmosphere, in the clear sky scenario, (i.e. no water or ice clouds in the sky)."

clearsky_gti,W/m2,Clearsky Global Tilted Irradiance (GTI),"Total irradiance received on a surface, if there are no clouds, with defined tilt and azimuth (sum of direct, diffuse and reflected components), fixed or tracking. Use Utility Scale Sites for the most accurate GTI (In the clear sky scenario, i.e. no water or ice clouds in the sky), because it is based on detailed PV system specifications including detailed tracker behaviour. When requesting GTI by latitude and longitude only, you'll need to specify array_type (""fixed"" or ""horizontal_single_axis""). If you specify an array_type of ""fixed"", you can optionally specify a tilt and azimuth, or else we assume default values (equatorward-facing azimuth, latitude-dependent tilt). If you specify an array_type of ""horizontal_single_axis"", you can specify the tracker axis angle as azimuth, or else we assume a default value of zero (i.e. tracker axis runs north-south). Tilt is ignored if provided for an array_type of ""horizontal_single_axis""."

snow_water_equivalent,cm,Snow water equivalent,is the snow depth liquid equivalent.
snowfall_rate,cm/h,Snowfall Rate ,"is the depth of snow falling per unit time. The snowfall rate is based on the water-equivalent amount of frozen precipitation falling per hour, converted to a solid snow depth using an estimate of the density of newly fallen snow. The snowfall rate will generally not match the change in the snow_depth output parameter over an hour. This is because snow_depth is also affected by other processes, such as melting, evaporation and changes in density of the total snow pack."
